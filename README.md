**Zomato Data Analysis**

  This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Zomato restaurant data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and insights extraction using Python.

**Dataset**

  The dataset contains information about restaurants, including ratings, votes, online order availability, restaurant types, and approximate costs for two people.

votes: Number of votes received

online_order: Whether online orders are available (Yes/No)

listed_in(type): Type of restaurant

approx_cost(for two people): Estimated cost for two people

**Code Overview:**

Data Loading: Reads the dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning: Converts rating values into numerical format.

**Visualizations:**

1) Count plots for listed_in(type) and online_order

2) Histogram of restaurant ratings

3) Boxplot of ratings vs. online order availability

4) Heatmap of restaurant type vs. online orders

5) Line plot showing total votes per restaurant type

**Insights:**
